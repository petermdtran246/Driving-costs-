Driving Cost Calculator

This Python program calculates the cost of driving based on the miles per gallon (MPG) of a car and the price of gas in dollars per gallon. It defines a function driving_cost() that takes three input parameters: miles_per_gallon, dollars_per_gallon, and miles_driven. The function returns the dollar cost to drive the specified number of miles.

Usage
  1. Input the car's miles per gallon and the price of gas in dollars per gallon when prompted.
  2. The program outputs the gas cost for driving 10 miles, 50 miles, and 400 miles by calling the driving_cost() function with different mileage distances.
Each floating-point value is displayed with two digits after the decimal point, ensuring accurate representation of the calculated costs.
